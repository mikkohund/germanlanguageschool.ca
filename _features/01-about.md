The goal of the Comox Valley German Language School (*CVGLS*) is to provide formal German language education to children with some German language background. We are located at [NIDES](http://www.navigatenides.com/) in Merville, BC, and we currently have students from the Comox Valley and Quadra Island.

We founded the society in 2015 and currently offer German language instruction to one class of students.
